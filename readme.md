# SampleCode

this code is still very much in progress, but it's the beginning of a new website, which heavily relies on images (as frames of a video). The first bit of code here allows the application to load the images using an ES2015 class.

To run, first run:
```npm install```

Followed by:
```gulp serve```

Check the network tab in your console for proof of loading
